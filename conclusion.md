## Summary

Overall, we were able to see that UFO sightings are increasing in numbers as the years progress. Sightings have grown by **9%** since the first sightings in 1998. Additionally, more than half of total UFO sightings have been spotted throughout the **West Coast** Region. If you're looking to have a better chance to catch your own UFO stay around the west coast, preferably **California** or **Washington**, and try to look for an object in the shape of a **triangle** flying through the sky.

Good luck to all of you UFO hunters!!
